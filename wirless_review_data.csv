The power button takes forever to turn on- I am pressing and holding and holding and pressing and there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason on how long it takes to press the button for the device to turn on.2. Some songs sound incredibly muffled and there is no way to fix the distortion / muffled sound.3. Voice-to-text does not work well at all. The speaker has an internal microphone that overrides the microphone on your device and cannot pick up on your voice unless you scream or stand right next to the speaker- useless if your'e in another room or not close to the speaker. There is no way to change this either.4.

R25X0TE59JOMS3,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Used Beats Pill 2024 still great.,Leila L’Abate,5.0,"I bought this used in ""acceptable"" condition, with no description as to actual condition. The previous two ""acceptable"" ones came with somewhat minor dents, but no original packaging, charge cord, or instructions. One of them smelled like something like Febreeze had been sprayed or rubbed on it. This one, the cheapest I have seen in this color, has no discernible scratches or dents and looks new, , arrived in the original, but extremely taped box, and had cord, instructions, and stickers. Jackpot! It should have been classified as ""very good"" or even, ""like new."" It sounds great, with movie theater very present bass sound. A little weak in the midrange when quiet or loud, but may be fixable in firmware, as may connectivity issues. As has been noted in other user reviews, it gets disconnected rather frequently for no discernible reason, is hard to maintain in paired modes for this reason, and makes a rather loud noise when turning on and off. One reviewing site reviewer downgraded it for having to hold the on /off button too long to turn it on and off. 2 or 3 seconds is too long? This is actually a great design feature that keeps it from accidentally turning off or on while in a bag or backpack while taking camping or to the beach. To prevent dents in transit I suggest keeping the well-designed protective box. Though I suspect the dented speakers were dropped. None of the carrying cases designed for this version of the Beats Pill, that I have ordered, had any real padding. If the case is hard enough this may not matter, but one was easily mushable. I'm thinking of just using the box. The only case I've found with real padding, and a nicely hard shell, is the co2CREA Hard Travel Case Replacement for JBL Flip 6 FLIP 5 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker Case. (This can be found cheaply in Amazon Resale in like -new condition.). The Pill fits snugly in this, though it mushes down the divider, but still leaves room for the charging cable and a plug in charger.The original Pill colors: red, gold, and black, come with a black plastic charging cord. The Kim Kardashian Pills come with cords that match the Pill color, and cross-hatched fiber covering, which may be better quality than the black cords? They are stiffer!The main feature that I went with the Pill for is the ""Lossless listening."" The ability to plug in the Pill directly to your device without having to use bluetooth. We have so much radiation already with wi-fi, phone, radio, and tv signals broadcasted all around us, I prefer not to have to add bluetooth to the mix. Plus the sound quality is better. Speakers that can use wi-fi also get better sound quality than bluetooth because of better bandwith.Though the Pill as yet has no online equalizer as other better quality speakers do, I find it does a great job adjusting to different kinds of audio, unlike say, an Echo Show 8, which has glorious stereo spatial audio sound, but has a hard time playing simple podcast and news talking voices understandably because of too heavy bass. But this can be adjusted with its online on speaker equalizer, lowering the bass to zero. The Pill automatically adjusts.",2025-02-09,AGRFASG4AR4DPZ2F3QWCB7II5P6A,False,0,"Color: Statement Red, Style: Pill, Set: Without AppleCare+",Beats Pill,1.0,550

It doesn’t work well.1st issue is when connected to my iPhone 14 Pro Max it will disconnect for no reason while I am playing music.2nd issue is that the volume will drop very low and then just goes up a couple of times and I can’t fix it.3rd issue is the sound quality. Every time for maybe 10 seconds the quality drops and it sounds like it’s under water.I don’t know why it’s having all these problems and I will bring it to Apple and if not fixable I will just trash it. If you are looking for one save your money and get a JBL or Bose they sound better than this anyway.,2025-02-03,AFTUDUHBZUB2HWJP4R5XU6PPOHNQ,False,1,"Color: Statement Red, Style: Pill, Set: Without AppleCare+",Beats Pill,0.0,128

Just try figuring out without searching online how to do that (including the extra step where you switch from amplify mode to stereo mode).Nothing about these speakers makes any sense at all. Here’s what I mean…The round shape makes them annoying to put in a pocket or fit just about anywhere.The sound is bland and empty with excessive bass. All they seemed to care about was bass. Never mind literally the entire rest of the audio spectrum.I couldn’t even figure out how to turn them off without looking it up. You have to hold the power button long enough but not too long.The final straw was the cumbersome stereo pairing process, which you have to do every time you turn them on because they don’t just remember they were paired together.It is shockingly bad, especially considering the brand and price.

R29HP1ZK7Y81XW,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Pair Up!,InspireBetterReviews,5.0,"My dad bought two of these. You won’t regret getting two, I actually suggest it over getting only one. The stereo separation is great. In our mid sized living room, 40% is loud and very room filling (also consider songs are different volumes). Very clear and high quality mid to treble, quite dynamic— My favorite so far in bluetooth/portable speakers. And adequate bass, nothing extreme but absolutely nothing lacking musically. When these first came out, they didn’t sound right, but they released a firmware update that made them 3x better, literally— they went from being worth $50 to the current full price of $150. Besides sound and price, as you would assume, they are light enough to carry with you— lightweight with a comfortable carry cable. What makes these speakers worth the price is the general size of sound that comes from them relative to the small physical size and portability. Taking two of these with you anywhere is like bringing a home stereo set with you in the size of two shampoo bottles. (If you’re looking for extreme bass though, you just need a bigger speaker. Don’t leave bad reviews for bass.)Important Note: We had to get the firmware update through Android.

Low and behold, I bought this. $120 down the drain, I can give you some bullet points. ""+"" will be a positive. ""-"" will be a negative.+ RuggedThis is a very rugged item, it did not understate that. Dust comes off fairly easily, whole thing is made of rubber and metal.+ Additional FunctionalityBit of a double edged sword, I don't like that some functionality is hidden behind the app. However, I do like the app functionality. You're able to adjust the bass, treble, etc to a finer point within the app, name your device, and even create a shortcut on the actual device. What I appreciate the most is that I am able to see the devices battery life when checking my bluetooth, however... This should probably have been present on the device. It will never tell you it's battery life visibly. You will only get simple call-outs. ""Battery Full"", ""Battery 70%"" etc, etc.- / + Volume & SoundThe volume is loud, if you are in a quiet room. In my noisy P1000 Stepvan, I was only able to hear the speaker faintly to moderately loud when I was delivering outside with the door open. You'd wish it would go higher, but no. Placing anything, and I mean even a simple backpack or cloth, in front of the speaker, will absolutely make the volume muffled and hard to hear. This means the speaker must be exposed to work. Aside from these 2 glaring issues, the speaker sounds great. It vibrates when set to the loudest of course, but the audio has bass, and the right amount of treble. It just sounds great for being so small.- BatteryThe battery life is poor, and despite claims of ""12 hours"" only actually lasts 1-3 hours when the device is on full blast. 3 is being generous of me. Luckily I have a large portable battery as well...- RangeThe devices range is questionable. In some circumstances, entering a building and physically only being a couple feet from the truck caused a disconnect. In other instances it did not. Other times I was able to walk a good while away, and the speaker maintained good connection. I have no idea why this is.+ Finishing ThoughtsDespite some glaring flaws (battery life, muffled sound / volume limitations) I think this speaker is very good for the size it comes in. Sound is nice and crisp, the speaker itself isn't all that heavy, it charges fast via USB-C, I suppose if you were on a trip it might be nice to have.",2025-03-05,AFJ7PU3IZOQF4RWAIQMTW3YTKXAA,False,3,Color: Black,Bose SoundLink Flex,0.75,442

The bass is strong, bot not too boomy, the middles and lows are fine too. It outputs a pleasant sound harmonics, especially if you listen to it outside. It is also rugged, loud (f needed) and waterproof.BAD: It gets unresponsive and stops charging. This happened once at the beginning, I reset it and I thought it was OK. I don't use the unit very often though. Still, it doesn't turn on periodically when you need it most (like a surprise party for wife). Afterwards you try to charge it and it doesn't charge. After a day or so after pressing the buttons for 10 seconds many times as manual suggests and unplugging the power cable and plugging back it accidentally turns on, and the battery is empty. Then you try to charge it and it may or may not do it.

It's not going to give you deep feeling bass like a boombox but as it hits the ear it's very impressive. The quality and feel is amazing - as usual for Anker. I will probably never test the battery length advertised, that being said, I don't doubt this company about that as their primary products are batteries and chargers. The silicon black is deep and doesn't have any hue, would be great if you want something less noticeable. Recommended.

I use it for my work and home laptop. Same quality, same sound and same satisfaction as with the first speaker. Love this little guy. I paired it with my wife's and the quality of sound was amazing. The instructions to pair are not entirely accurate. I would watch the video instead. Not complicated but the video method works and is easy to follow. I haven't fully taken advantage of the portable feature (speaker on the go) but I can easily see that it would be convenient and effective. Do it! You won't be disappointed.Believe the hype! I looked over the reviews and was impressed by the responses. The images showed it as well-made and durable. I like that it's waterproof as this would be a shower speaker for my wife. Her current speaker is tinny and super low quality. For $30 I figured I couldn't go wrong. It arrived well-packaged and with a 50% charge. It connected to our phones easily and quickly. We are thoroughly impressed with the sound. This little guy packs a punch. My only word of caution is you cannot custom tune this model with the SoundCore app. It appears this is the only model not supported. I'm happy with the stock preset so it really wasn't an issue. This would make a great speaker for work or for my home laptop. I will definitely order one for myself.",2025-03-17,AGRYRFEJRYM447HUFGL3RLI2N3TA,False,0,Color: Black,Anker Soundcore 2,1.0,249

Initially, I was delighted with them, using them for music and surround sound. However, an update disrupted my control over the volume using my iPhone. While I could previously control the volume through the Sonos app, it has become incredibly slow and unresponsive. Additionally, there are no Sonos remote control devices available for controlling the speakers.In essence, these speakers are only suitable for setting up as surround sound (now known as Dolby Atmos) for TVs, not for music playback. It’s worth noting that the surround sound system does require a wired ARC HDMI connection to the Sonos Arc, indicating that the entire system is not entirely wireless.We recently replaced our TV with a ceiling-mounted projector and realized that we need to run an eARC HDMI cable through the walls to connect to the Sonos Arc for surround sound. If you want to listen to music on the speakers, you’re constantly forced to switch between your music app (Spotify) and the Sonos app to play music. Both apps attempt to monopolize control.I wish I had the option to return all my gear.",2025-03-16,AEZICC6P2JL4CFUP65GCQ4ZIIHLA,False,0,"Color: White, Size: 1-Speaker",Sonos Era 100,0.0,192

It seems to work as well as any audio on iPhones works (barely, these days), and not at all from the Mac. After investing $250, it's extraordinarily disappointing for support to be dropped less than a year into ownership. If you don't own a Mac, maybe it's worth it. If you're willing to skip all the smarts you're paying for and just plug it in, sure maybe. But it's not a super flexible Apple compatible product. It's actually very limited.

Shnelberg,2.0,"I have made a significant investment in setting up Amazon smart speakers throughout my home. I have been very happy with the experience but, seeing the Sonos Era 100 with a pretty good sale price, thought I would treat myself by updating the original and still working great Echo I bought in 2017.It was a mistake!The Sonos Era 100 sounds great but it does not play well with others. Basically, it has disrupted the functionality of my home's entire setup. The Sonos speaker hijacks commands. For example, this morning I asked the newest version of the Echo in my bedroom (named ""bedroom"") to play a local radio station. That device, which was about two feet away from me confirmed my command, but did not carry it out. Instead, I heard the Sonos speaker in another part of the house playing the requested station. Commands can carried out incorrectly even when I name the speaker in my request. For my second attempt this morning, I asked the Echo in my bedroom, ""Alexa, please play (station's call letters) on Bedroom."" The bedroom Echo confirmed that command back to me but then played the station on the Echo in my bathroom. This happens at least once a day when I am trying to use Amazon devices in my home. The only fix I have found - and not an acceptable one - is disconnecting the Sonos speaker.I called Sonos customer service about the problem today. That call lasted over 45 minutes. The rep putting me on hold multiple times and made it very clear both her English and understanding of the product were insufficient to provide support. (I have taught ESL so I know neither my speed nor vocabulary should have been a barrier.) The only thing she was able to do was direct me to open the Sonos app, but not what to do once I opened it. Ultimately, after nearly an hour, she took my contact info, told me she escalated the issue, and asked me to wait a few days for someone else to call me.I should have ignored the sale price, the well-marketed Sonos name, and treated myself to an Echo Studio,",2025-01-06,AHPGLUVBDVNGK57J5QP3JRILHCMA,False,1,"Color: Black, Size: 1-Speaker",Sonos Era 100,0.25,363

R385NCNIRDKP67,B0BW34LCB8,1.0 out of 5 stars Gigantic POS,Ken Solberg,1.0,"Second SONOS product I tried to get to work.Wanted a good speaker that could play music from Wifi (as opposed to bluetooth) and had a line in so I could connect a turntable to it.It couldn't adequately do either. It's possible I need a preamp for my turntable, however, I have never needed one for other speakers, so... questionable, but it never gave any indication that there was a component plugged in that it recognized and the rest of the app was so confusing and flaky that I just don't think it would work with a preamp.As far as the app and playing music stuff - you know, what Sonos is known for? It can't do that, either. If you have a simple single wifi source - better yet, willing to connect it to ethernet (you'll need a 40$ dongle for that) it may work. On the other end of the spectrum, if you're a network admin you might be able to figure out how to get to work on a home mesh network. BUT even if you have a simple network or the knowledge to waste on this product you will NOT enjoy using it.The app's interface with Apple Music is not as useful as the native app (unsure about spotify, but nothing with my short experience with this product lends itself to being optimistic) to the point that it's annoying to find music. While I may get used to searching harder for music to play, I won't get used to CONSTANTLY resetting/restarting the system so my app actually can pair with the device and play music (because I'm returning it as soon as I complete this review).I've noted that many longtime users are also quite frustrated with the new app. I don't plan to wait it out until they fix it. Yes, I have been on with customer service and ""support."" They advised me to 1) Change the fundamental design of my mesh network in a way that would lose significant functionality and 2) Do something that would limit the wifi frequencies MY PHONE would be able to link with. Despite not wanting to actually do that, I humored them and set my network to only allow 2.4ghz frequencies and that didn't work, either.Just a giant, worthless problem. Not worth it for them to pay me to try to use this crap. Not sure how this made it out of R&D, it's an absolute embarassment of a product and makes me want to never buy a Sony product ever again.

It'll be interesting to see how many people are new to Sonos (post new app or previous light users) versus long time Sonos users some w many speakers. We are probably not going to find out here. Mods delete posts and or new clients w a few or new products don't have the issue. I've installed Sonos on multiple homes over and over. In my own home alone there are 12 speakers. Was expensive as hell. But it worked flawlessly. And 100% wireless (reason for buying them). Different ISPs , different wifi models. Some homes have mesh wifi, other pods and other regular routers. The reason I kept buying it and recommending it was because it was headache-free. Just Plug it into an electric outlet and go! Now people are recommending using LAN Cables, etc. They're missing the point that Sonos pitch was "" you don't need any wires"" for the speakers just plug them in. Even when they started changing products they issued a new app. The original for original-equipment only systems. And the new one for new or hybrid systems. All good. The systems always worked. Till they decided to go cloud rip out the code that made it all work.(See post from Sonos engineer ) . There were even better features I didn't list like it would work with ANY and all music streaming services. SiriusXM, Apple, Amazon Music, Spotify, etc Even YouTube music. Even LP turntables. And multiple people could use the system at your home or others (sign in to a guest system). Finally you could also play the same music everywhere or play different music on different rooms/speakers. My wife Could play something in one room, guests in others. All wirelessly. You could DJ by switching songs midstream. Change volume instantly. If you can do that today flawlessly and wirelessly at the same time in several rooms. Then you are very lucky.

We don’t have the strongest or most advanced WiFi network so I anticipated having issues—and I did.I hit my frustration threshold after trying for a couple hours to connect to my WiFi in the initial system setup. The simplest of things were just not working and troubleshooting tips online weren’t helping. Left them alone to tackle it again the next day.I had the same issues on the next attempt. So I gave in and called Sonos Support—they were wonderful. I had to download an app on my laptop and download a couple updates. The customer service rep guided me through the process and was just as excited as I was when we got everything working properly.I mention all this first because I know concerns about connectivity/issues with the app might stop a lot of people from buying these. While certainly not as easy as it should be, issues were fixed relatively easily through Sonos support.And my God—the sound quality of these speakers are amazing. You forget any troubles you had the moment you turn up the volume on your favorite music. I do consider myself an amateur audiophile and these speakers are worth the money. Hopefully Sonos is making progress with their system so that less people have to call support just for the initial setup. Removed half a star just for this.TLDR: Connectivity issues are real but fixable; sound quality is amazing.",2024-12-10,AFDYTHNTGRFLNNCZU4HRTGIKXCGA,False,38,"Color: White, Size: 1-Speaker",Sonos Era 100,1.0,252

Added Era 100 in another room. After the initial setup, the app says no products found. The troubleshooting says reset the wifi router. I worked in Tech/Software for decades, so that is a drastic step when all other 30+ connected devices are working properly. I did it anyway and that did not resolve connectivity. I tried multiple sessions of factory resets, setting up each speaker again, adding the room, re-adding the room, updating the app, updating software to each speaker with limited results. The android app sometimes detects your speaker, but most of the time, nothing. I used iOS device to setup and same poor results. My wife asked why I bought these. She just wants to listen to music.

These speakers don't allow you to play ""local files"". They also don't work with spotify DJ. Not only does the dj voice not come through, it won't shuffle between genres. You would think that high end speakers would work seamlessly with the number one music streaming service, but that's not the case. Making every speaker the same volume isn't as simple as it should be, you have to start each session by leveling them out individually. Then, when using the volume bar on the side of your phone, you have to press it around 7-10 times before there is any noticeable difference.

R2GL9NUQVHG578,B0CVFM97GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great if you're into bass-heavy audio,deebee,4.0,"This speaker gets a lot right. The battery life is excellent, and pairing is quick and reliable. I’ve never had any connection drops, and it consistently links up faster than most (to be fair, less expensive) Bluetooth speakers I’ve used. It’s sturdy, waterproof, and ""drop-proof""—which I appreciate because the tall, cylindrical design isn’t exactly the most stable. I’ve knocked it over a few times by accident. To be honest, I’m not sure how far you can push the “drop-proof” claim, but so far, so good. Supposedly it even floats, though I haven’t tested that out yet.Design-wise, it’s sleek, but sometimes form outweighs function. The oversized volume buttons are cool to look at but not the most intuitive. They’re pretty flush to the surface, and the minus button is positioned vertically, creating a shape that resembles a cross. A friend even asked, “I didn’t know you were religious,” when they saw it sitting on the counter.Sound-wise, it’s bass-heavy—maybe a little too much. They really cranked up the low end on the EQ. It’s great for certain types of music, but if you listen to podcasts or audiobooks (like I do, often in the shower), it can make dialogue harder to follow. If spoken word is your go-to, this might not be the best fit.About that ""magic button""—I’m not sure what makes it magic. Beyond skipping tracks, I haven’t found much else for it to do. It feels a little underwhelming. The buttons on top aren’t labeled, which I assume is an aesthetic choice, but it doesn’t make them easier to use.On the bright side, the speaker is tough, pairs effortlessly, and sounds powerful (even if the balance is a little off). For the price, though, I expected more premium packaging.

I needed to purchase an adjustable water bottle cage (I chose the Arundel Looney BIN CAGE BLK, which seems fine). The speaker is a little big and has some weight, so it may not be great for serious long rides, but it's perfect for a casual loop on a weekend. I assumed because it cost more that the sound would be better than the basic model, so i spent the extra $$$, but i have no idea if it's any better. The sound is pretty good, plenty of bass. If you're thinking of doing this, you could trade sound quality for size and fit and get the lower end model and it might fit in a standard sized bottle cage.",2024-12-03,AF5K7F2JSU5EJH5OCRQTFF7WWH2A,False,5,Color: Blue,Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4,0.75,141

R3ACCYFLY88GRU,B0CVFM97GD,1.0 out of 5 stars Honestly NOT worth the high price,Glen Sankey,1.0,"I found this speaker very unimpressive for the exhorbitantly high price. I expected a top end sound with depth and base. There was not. Sound was “tinny” and the speaker dramatically lacked any kind of bass. I tried multiple songs and music genres from my playlist. Comparing it to my $80 Bose Soundlink II and the Bose sounded as good if not better. This is just a fair speaker, nothing in particularly outstanding about it, tho you may like the app for controlling it. I returned mine within a half hour and went with the JBL charge for the same price. I expect that feelable bass and depth from that product. This Ult Ear product would be decent if it were priced at around $100, but no more.Update: As stated I got the CHARGE5 from JBL and it costs around the same as this one. BUT the sound was dramatically superior to the (not so) Ultimate Ears MegaBoom speaker for $200. I’m extremely glad I made the switch to JBL, I get nothing from them for this, except the all around higher quality sound with an appropriate amount of sub woofer to it.If you’re considering which one, then go with the JBL Charge of the Flip is a little cheaper but I do not have one of those. Speaking of cheaper, like I said before, the Bose Soundlink Color 2 is a great quality compact speaker for less than $100, that puts out a rich depth kind of sound.

After listening to it for the first time, I was kinda let down by its sound quality. To start out, the build quality is great. I mean it's a really well made speaker, but at its price point it's lacking in the sound department. At higher volume I noticed some distortion that I wouldn't expect from a premium speaker like this. At low volume it has a nice warm and rich sound, but anything over 70% the sound in my opinion starts to fall apart like the bass begins to sound kinda muddy. I will say that it does do a good job at having the 360 degree sound. I also feel that it should be a little louder in the volume department.Now for some of the good stuff that I like about this speaker. It has a feature that it can be used as a loud speaker to where I can speak into my phone and it will broadcast my voice like a voice amplifier. I also like that I can use it with my smart assistants. It also has a simple to navigate app. The app seems kind of basic but gets the job done. I do like the look and size of it. I think the big volume controls on the side of it looks pretty cool. I do like the portability of this speaker.The battery life is decent. I will say that I do wish it had a better way of displaying the battery levels. Overall I would say that it's not the best and not the worst bluetooth speaker that I've heard.

R3ZWLZFF6E68R,B0CVFM97GD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding speaker, especially when paired with multiple speakers",Beck72,5.0,"I really like this MEGABOOM 4 speaker. I was shocked to hear the sound, especially the bass out of a speaker this size.I'll start with build and function: This speaker is built well with a quality feel and look to it. The build feels very sturdy. It has a distinct look with the large plus and minus signs on the front to control the volume. The look seems to be a bit polarizing where some people really like it, others not so much. One thing I really like about the BOOM speakers is that they don't have flashing LED lights. I think that gives Bluetooth speakers a cheap look and feel. These have a more professional look that fits in an office or family room. I really like that it has 360 degree sound because it seems to fill the room with sound as opposed to sounding like a single mono speaker. The speaker is pretty heavy for it's size, which is a good sign for a speaker. I've always found that heavier speakers sound better. It has the ""Magic Button"" on top to control many of the speakers functions. At first, I wasn't sure I liked this feature, but now that I'm used to it, I really like it. The PARTYUP feature that allows you to connect multiple speakers is great. This speaker sounds great alone, but when connected to other BOOM speakers they sound amazing. I've connected to other MEGABOOM speakers and to BOOM speakers and they sound great, but I'd love to try connecting it with an Everboom or one of the larger speakers to add even more deep bass. The battery life has been great. So far I've averaged 17 hours on a charge but have gotten as much as 21 hours from time to time. This speaker was very easy to pair with my Bluetooth devices. It is a bit tricky to open the cover over the charging port, but I guess that's what you want to keep water out. One thing I didn't realize this speaker can do is connect to my Amazon music account. It will play my top 5 Amazon Music playlists, even if it's not near my phone as long as it has a wifi connection.Sound Quality - I've seen several reviews that say the sound quality isn't great. Personally, I think the sound is amazing, but to get that, I had to create a custom EQ setting using the Ultimate Ears app. I will say, to get the most out of this speaker you do have to use the app. The speaker comes preloaded with 5 EQ settings that are OK. My favorite is the ""Cramped Spaces"" setting, but I still felt like it was missing something. I tried to adjust that EQs option and it created a custom setting for me. Using my custom setting I was able to create an EQ that I think sounds incredible. It has strong bass and very clear highs and mids, and it gets really loud if your into that. The highs and mids from this speaker are amazingly clear and I was shocked at the amount of bass I can get out of a speaker this size. Obviously it isn't going to replace a subwoofer, but it can go pretty deep it's size. The good thing is that even when adding more bass, it doesn't ruin the clear highs. With a lot of speakers you sacrifice the high notes to get more bass. One thing to note, I did notice a decrease in the high note clarity when using the bass boost EQ setting, but in my custom setting I get the more bass and the clear highs.As I mentioned above, this speaker sounds great alone, but it sounds amazing paired with other BOOM speakers. Having them paired allowed for sound that can really feel a a room our outdoor space.Overall, if you are looking for a great sounding Bluetooth speaker, you can’t go wrong with this speaker, but you may need to create a custom EQ setting to fit your sound preferences. The only issue I can see with this speaker is that the great sound comes at a premium price. There are other speakers out there that can produce similar sound for less money, but I have yet to find one that can produce such clear highs and mids while producing as this much bass. I think this speaker is worth the price.",2024-08-15,AHZZQ2ZRNELOE3BK5S6K3HHHKJHQ,False,0,Color: Black,Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4,1.0,743

Bass, mids and treble are very present and the speaker has a 360 sound profile. I have listened to many types of music on this speaker and every genre I tried sounds great. The Ultimate ears app that you can download gives you more control over the sound with a built in graphic equalizer and you can even turn the speaker off and on with it and makes the speaker extra easy to use.

The speaker is paired with an app where I was able to create my personalized sound mixes even though the speaker has preset option which optimize vocals (podcasts) versus music. I'm also in love with how rugged the case for Megaboom is, I have very enthusiastic kids who literally tumble around with the speaker in and outdoors and the fact I don't have to freak out that the speaker will die if it falls in the kid's pool is worth so much money. I'm still working my way through Megaboom's more niche features so I haven't tried out linking it with other speakers yet or setting up a playlist.The main reason for docking one star from my review is that there was a period when my speaker would not charge. Everything was set up correctly, I plugged in a functioning UBC cord and connected it with an outlet but no charge.

I broke the charging port on my old Oontz and I wish I’d fixed it instead of throwing it away because they stopped making it in white (which blends in with my decor). So now I overpaid for this not very loud JBL and the design is ok but I still like the all white triangular design of the Oontz better.

Amazon reported net sales of $638.0 billion in 2024.

R1ZGJJHMOOTX6K,B09ZXLRRHY,"2.0 out of 5 stars Terrible if you want Spotify or Audible, or want it to respond to your voice. Decent sound quality.",JanaMay,2.0,"We have now tried several Echos. Our goal was to give our young daughter (5, not reading yet) an easy way to navigate to music and audiobooks that she loves. We have tried the Echo dot for kids, the full size dot, and now this one. The sound quality is fine. The problem is the voice recognition is difficult. I see these ads where people simply ask their Alexa to do stuff and it does, but in my experience it chooses the wrong song or album eight times out of ten, seems confused about when it's ""allowed"" to do stuff in kid mode and not (like, it will accidentally choose extremely profane songs and then refuse to play Daniel Tiger soundtracks, all for no discernible reason. It's been restarted and reset with voice recognition. It's literally next to the wifi router. We have Alexa on our phones. It simply doesn't play nice with our child. I thought it was because we use Spotify, and figured, well, at least it will be excellent with Audible because that's an Amazon company... but it's even worse. It doesn't know what books it has, it will only play a book if it was the last one used or if I go on my phone. It often says that it can't play audiobooks because ""I'm not allowed to do that right now"" even though we only have it set to downtime after her bedtime. It's really terrible and this is the third Alexa piece of poop that we've put out in a free box on the corner.
